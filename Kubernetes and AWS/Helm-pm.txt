This scenario teaches you how to use Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes, to deploy Redis. Helm simplifies discovering and deploying services to a Kubernetes cluster.

"Helm is the best way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes."
More details can be found on their website at http://www.helm.sh/


Install Helm
Helm is a single binary that manages deploying Charts to Kubernetes. A chart is a packaged unit of kubernetes software. It can be downloaded from https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/releases

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.8.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf helm-v2.8.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/

Once installed, initialise update the local cache to sync the latest available packages with the environment.

helm init --stable-repo-url https://charts.helm.sh/stable
helm repo update

Search For Chart
You can now start deploying software. To find available charts you can use the search command.

For example, to deploy Redis we need to find a Redis chart.

helm search redis

We can identify more information with the inspect command.

helm inspect stable/redis


Deploy Redis
Use the install command to deploy the chart to your cluster.

helm install stable/redis

Helm will now launch the required pods. You can view all packages using helm ls

If you receive an error that Helm could not find a ready tiller pod, it means that helm is still deploying. Wait a few moments for the tiller Docker Image to finish downloading.

In the next step we'll verify the deployment status.


See Results
Helm deploys all the pods, replication controllers and services. Use kubectl to find out what was deployed.

kubectl get all

The pod will be in a pending state while the Docker Image is downloaded and until a Persistent Volume is available.

kubectl apply -f pv.yaml

Redis needs permissions to write chmod 777 -R /mnt/data*

Once complete it will move into a running state. You'll now have a Redis Cluster running on top of Kubernetes.

The helm could be provided with a more friendly name, such as:

helm install --name my-release stable/redis
