Create an Automated Project Setup on Atlassian Stack : 	JIRA Project Setup

1.Open jira -> Projects -> New project.
2.Select a suitable template for your project.
3.Type a project name and make sure to give a correct key to your project as changing key name after creation is a   bit difficult.
4.Click on create and you will be directed to your project home page.
5.Automatically a project board will be created by jira or you can also create your own project board.
6.On the LHS there are backlogs, sprints and many other features. Just take a tour around.
7.Go to project settings if you want to change any user settings.
8.Workflow can be changed as per your requirements.


CREATING A SPRINT:
There are different types of issues that can be created in jira:

Epic
A big user story that needs to be broken down. Epics group together bugs, stories, and tasks to show the progress of a larger initiative. In agile development, epics usually represent a significant deliverable, such as a new feature or experience in the software your team develops.

Bug
A bug is a problem which impairs or prevents the functions of a product.
Story
A user story is the smallest unit of work that needs to be done.

Task
A task represents work that needs to be done.

Subtask
A subtask is a piece of work that is required to complete a task. Subtasks issues can be used to break down any of your standard issues in Jira (bugs, stories or tasks).


Create any type of issues, letâ€™s say an epic and start sprint by giving the start & end date of the sprint.
The sprint will alert you above the issues in your project
