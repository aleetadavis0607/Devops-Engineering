Docker Learning Outcomes:

•Pull a docker image from docker hub and build it.
•Creating docker-compose file
•Creating your own docker image and push it to the hub
•Deploying a web application using docker containers.


Steps to deploy a java application using docker:

1.Create Dockerfile.
2.docker build –t aleetadavis/hello-world-java:0.0.2.RELEASE .
3.The above command will build the application and deploy it to the server.
4.docker run -d -p 5000:5000 aleetadavis/hello-world-java:0.0.2.RELEASE
5.To push the docker image to the docker hub 
  docker push aleetadavis/hello-world-java:0.0.2.RELEASE

Similarly for any application we can build,run and push the a[[lication to the server.
