JENKINS CI CD PIPELINE USING GIT

1.Open virtual machine and start Jenkins & docker server.
2.Sign in to Jenkins using user credentials.
3.Create 3 jobs, as job1 – Build, job 2 – Test, job 3 – Deploy.
4.To create job : New item -> Job name -> Freestyle project -> Create
5.Repeat the same for job2 & job 3 as well.
6.For connecting your repository link:
7.Job 1 -> Configure -> Source code management -> git -> URL ->save & apply.
8.Repeat the same for job2&3.
 

For Jenkins to build continuously we need to install maven and its dependencies.
1.Configure job 1 -> Build -> Build using shell commands -> Mention the code directory & maven install(Required   commands) -> Save &Apply.
2.After job 1 is build and success, it should be deployed to a docker container. For that we need to build a docker   container in job 2.
3.Configure job2 -> Build -> Shell commands.
4.In the shell commands mention the directory, commands to create docker container etc  -> Save

In job 3, we need to deploy the application after successful building & testing.
Configure job 3 -> Build -> Shell commands -> Mention the docker container build in the previous job.
Save & Apply.

Since it is a CI CD pipeline all the 3 jobs must be interconnected.
For that, Jenkins should know which job must be executed next after completing one job.
Configure job1 -> Post build actions -> Build other job -> job 2.
Similarly configure job 2 as well.

CREATING PIPELINE :
1.Click on the ‘+’ above the jobs.
2.Type the view name (Pipeline name)
3.Click on build pipeline view.
4.Mention from where pipeline should start.
5.Apply & OK.
6.Pipeline is created.
7.Run the pipeline and your jobs will be continuously integrated
